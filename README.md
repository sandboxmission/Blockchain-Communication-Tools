# Blockchain Communication Tools

A proof-of-concept toolkit for using Ethereum blockchain as a decentralized communication medium. This project demonstrates how blockchain transaction data can be repurposed for messaging and file storage beyond traditional token transfers.

## üöÄ Overview

This toolkit consists of two main components:
- **Blockchain Scanner**: Python GUI application for monitoring and discovering messages stored in blockchain transactions
- **Minimal Writer**: Browser-based tool for sending UTF-8 messages directly to the blockchain

The system treats the blockchain as a "carrier wave" for communication - similar to how CB radio or early ICQ worked, but in a decentralized, permanent, and censorship-resistant manner.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Blockchain Scanner (`blockchain_scanner.py`)
- **Multi-Network Support**: Ethereum Mainnet and Sepolia testnet
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous scanning for new messages
- **Smart Data Processing**: Handles various formats (UTF-8, Base64, LZ-compressed, JSON)
- **ETH_FILE_DATA Support**: Special format for file storage on blockchain
- **Message Filtering**: Filter by content type (text, files, JSON)
- **Persistent Cache**: Saves discovered messages between sessions
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects RPC endpoint limits
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient scanning with configurable batch sizes

### Minimal Writer (`minimalwrite.html`)
- **MetaMask Integration**: Direct wallet connectivity
- **UTF-8 Support**: Send any text including emojis and special characters
- **Gas Estimation**: Automatic transaction cost calculation
- **Network Detection**: Ensures correct network selection
- **Real-time Status**: Transaction confirmation and error handling
- **CORS Requirements**: Must be served via live server (not file://)
- **No External Dependencies**: Works with any modern browser and MetaMask

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MetaMask browser extension
- Sepolia testnet ETH for transactions

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install customtkinter requests lzstring
```

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Run the scanner: `python blockchain_scanner.py`
4. For the writer:
   - **Live Server Required**: Due to CORS restrictions, `minimalwrite.html` must be served via HTTP server
   - **Python**: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/minimalwrite.html`
   - **VS Code**: Use "Live Server" extension
   - **Node.js**: `npx serve .` or `npx http-server`

### Pre-compiled Versions
- **Windows Executable**: A compiled .exe version of the scanner is available in releases for users who prefer not to install Python

## üìñ Usage

### Discovering Messages
1. Launch the blockchain scanner
2. Enter Ethereum addresses to monitor (default addresses included)
3. Select networks (Sepolia recommended for testing)
4. Choose scan method:
   - **Date-based**: Scan from specific date
   - **Block-based**: Scan from specific block numbers
   - **Real-time**: Monitor for new transactions
5. View discovered messages in the filtered list
6. Click messages for detailed analysis

### Sending Messages
1. **Start a live server** (required due to CORS):
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - VS Code: Use "Live Server" extension  
   - Node.js: `npx serve .`
2. Open `http://localhost:8000/minimalwrite.html` in your browser
3. Connect MetaMask wallet
4. Ensure you're on Sepolia testnet
5. Enter recipient address and message
6. Send transaction via MetaMask

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Discovered in the Wild
During testing on Sepolia testnet, we found various experimental messages:
- Simple greetings ("hello", "test")
- Random phrases ("im luna", "blockchain explorer")
- Experimental data formats
- File storage attempts

### Potential Applications
- **Decentralized Messaging**: Censorship-resistant communication
- **Proof of Existence**: Timestamp documents on blockchain
- **Dead Drop Systems**: Asynchronous message exchange
- **Blockchain Guestbooks**: Permanent visitor logs
- **Research Data**: Immutable scientific observations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Privacy and Permanence
- **All data is PUBLIC**: Anyone can read blockchain transactions
- **Data is PERMANENT**: Cannot be deleted or modified
- **No encryption included**: Messages are stored as plain text
- **Transaction costs**: Each message requires gas fees

### Cost Implications
- **Sepolia**: Free testnet ETH required
- **Mainnet**: Real ETH costs (can be expensive for large data)
- **Gas optimization**: Smaller messages cost less

### Legal and Ethical
- Respect local laws regarding data storage
- Do not store illegal content
- Consider data privacy regulations
- Be mindful of blockchain bloat
